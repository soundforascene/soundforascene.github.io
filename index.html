            <h1>Solar Instrument</h1>
            <p class="discription"> I created this Instrument during my final semester of university. This instrument focuses on creating a new style of performance. Within this model of the solar system, each planet holds musical potential. This can be heard through the control of the amplitude and frequency of an oscillator, and low-frequency oscillator. In future iterations of this project, I aim to host the instrument for wide-scale availability and include networking capacity allowing multiple players to control separate planets from their own devices.</p>

            <h1>Journey Away, 2019</h1>
            <p class="discription">This proof of concept mini-game was created during the 2019 Develop: Brighton Game Jam. The game follows Brighton's West Pier as it leaves the city in an attempt to find new purpose at sea. To create the original sound design and soundtrack for such a site-specific piece I chose to record clashing waves and whirling gulls of Brighton Beach. The instrument heard playing the melody is created using the samples I recorded.

            <h1>Ensemble Non-Linear</h1>
            <p class="discription">During my time in attendance at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, I joined the Ensemble Non-Linear. This performance group aimed to create new instruments for group performance focused on the audio programming language ChucK. This video demonstrates our use of technology at the time but also our style of performance.</p>

            <h1>Ensemble Instrument</h1>
            <p class="discription">In my time with Ensemble Non-Linear, I was able to create a performance piece with fellow member, Peter Ko. In this video, you will hear the sounds of a slowly growing fire. Performers were required to move around the performance space in an attempt to subdue the fire with specific key commands on computers placed around the space.            </p>

            <p class="discription">During my time in attendance at professor Shawn Lawson's class at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, I joined forces with fellow student Arielle Cerini in creating a live audio-visual coding piece utilising SuperCollider and TidalCycles.</p>

            <h1>Short Films</h1>
            <p class="discription">During my final years at university, I created a series of short films. These films all followed themes of science-fiction and space travel. Although the films contain no dialogue they are intended as textural pieces on how I envision emotional responses to world-altering new technologies.            </p>

            <h1>Soundscape Instrument</h1>
            <p class="discription">Soundscape Instrument allows a performer to convert their gestures into musical triggers. Utilizing the Microsoft Kinect in tandem with Max/MSP, I was able to capture the players' skeletal tracking points and map them to triggers within Ableton giving the performer control of panning, amplitude, start/stop, etc.            </p>
